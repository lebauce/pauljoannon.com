A.k.a. **Paulloz**.  

Lead developper on [Bury me, my love](http://burymemylove.arte.tv/).  
Before that I was doing stuff at [Lib√©&nbsp;Six&nbsp;Plus](http://www.liberation.fr/data-nouveaux-formats-six-plus,100538), [Journalism++](http://jplusplus.org/) and with [My&nbsp;Sweet&nbsp;Whomp](https://mysweetwhomp.itch.io/).

Some time ago I spoke of videogames on [Livegen](http://livegen.fr/) and music on several blogs.  

I'm making photos when I'm not messing around on Twitter, Reddit or IRC.  

Oh, and I occasionally write (in French) on my [blog](/blog).
