A.k.a. **Paulloz**.  
I create videogames (well... I try to) with [My&nbsp;Sweet&nbsp;Whomp](http://mysweetwhomp.fr/). Before that I was doing stuff at [Lib√©&nbsp;Six&nbsp;Plus](http://www.liberation.fr/data-nouveaux-formats-six-plus,100538) [Journalism++](http://jplusplus.org/). Some time ago I speaked of videogames on [Livegen](http://livegen.fr/) and music on several blogs.  

I'm making photos when I'm not messing around on Twitter, Reddit or IRC.  
Oh, and I occasionally write (in French) on my [blog](/blog).
